*dbdroid* is an object-relational mapping (ORM) library for Android, providing a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a traditional relational database.

*dbdroid* is free software that is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

*dbdroid* creates a mapping from Java classes to tables of a database, and from Java data types to SQL data types.

*dbdroid* uses an XML configuration file that declares the DAOs (Data Access Object). Each DAO is associated with a Java class with the Entity annotation. It is this Java class that is mapped to a table in the database.
So we have: a DAO => a Entity => a table.

== Entity Annotation ==

To create an Entity, just add the 'Entity' annotation to a Java class

{{{
@Entity
public class MyEntity {
...
}
}}}

You can add the 'name' attribute to the 'Entity' annotation to define the table name to create in the database.

{{{
@Entity(name="my_entity")
public class MyEntity {
...
}
}}}

== Entity fields ==

== ID Annotation ==
